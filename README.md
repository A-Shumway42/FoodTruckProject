# Food Truck Project

## Description.
This is my second project while at Skill Distillery. The code you are seeing is created to mimic a Food Truck rating application.
The user enters up to 5 trucks with fields containing the name, food type and the rating of the food truck. After the user has created their list, a
menu opens up with options to review the list made, generate the average of all ratings, display the highest-rated truck and to finally quit the application.

## What I Learned.
I was able to learn a great deal while working on this project. My biggest trouble before this project was accessing the information inside the arrays
and printing to the screen. Working with access modifiers, specifically public and private modifiers, helped me understand how to gather the information.
I believe my syntax in Java has improved tremendously.

## Technologies Used.
I used Java, Eclipse, Git and the Terminal.
